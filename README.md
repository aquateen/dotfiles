My .files

## Setup
Clone this repo to your home directory and use stow to symlink these dot files to your home dir.

For vim, install vundle with `git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim` and run `:PluginInstall` in vim.

For airline, promptline, and tmuxline, see their respective quickstart guides.

Probably the icons won't display properly, install patched fonts from https://github.com/powerline/fonts. Remember to set iTerm non-ascii font.
